## Introduction

Dotty is a console application which loads information from a file and outputs an integer to the console.

**ALL THE CODE IS YOURS TO MODIFY, DELETE OR UPDATE.**

## Task

The application must read the input file and return the corresponding integer.
The input file contains periods and spaces, like a piece of ASCII art, that resemble the shape of an integer.

An example of an input file resembling an ASCII `3` is included in the project: `input.txt`. Dotty should output the integer `3` to the console upon receiving this file.

## Notes

1. You can assume that any input file will only contain the equivalent of a single integer and they will always be 5 characters wide and 7 rows of data.
2. You can assume input will always be from a txt file.
3. Ideally when the tech test is finished the application should be expandable to handle all integers from 0 to 9.
4. You are free to search online and ask questions.
